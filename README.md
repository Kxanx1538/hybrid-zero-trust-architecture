# üîê Hybrid Multi-Cloud Zero Trust Architecture with Lean SOC



Welcome to my cybersecurity engineering showcase‚Äîa real-world hybrid multi-cloud architecture I designed and implemented using Zero Trust principles integrated with a Lean SOC model across On-Prem, Azure, AWS, and SaaS ecosystem.  The design integrates identity, access control, security monitoring, automation, governance, and secure remote access across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS environments.

|**‚è±Ô∏è Attack Timeline: Tracing a Multi-Stage, Multi-User Incident Across Cloud Platforms**
This timeline view captures the beginning of my investigation into a ‚ÄúMulti-stage incident involving multiple users‚Äù, as automatically surfaced by Microsoft Sentinel‚Äôs Fusion engine. The timeline shows how the attack unfolded in distinct phases ‚Äî starting with suspicious resource deployments and progressing to privileged role assignments across user accounts. This high-level chronology helped me quickly identify lateral movement and escalation patterns. By tracing the flow of alerts over time across Entra ID, Defender for Cloud, and Azure Activity, I was able to prioritize critical events for deeper inspection. This temporal correlation is foundational to Zero Trust enforcement and operational agility in a Lean SOC.  |![Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel Investigation Graph showing cross-domain correlated entities including IPs, users, and resources](./assets/Correlated_story_telling.png)           |
| **üîç Alert Deep Dive: Investigating Privileged Role Assignment in a Multi-Stage Threat**
Building on the timeline, I pivoted into focused analysis of a specific alert within the ‚ÄúMulti-stage incident involving multiple users.‚Äù This screenshot shows the Microsoft Sentinel Investigation Graph with the Info pane open, centered on a ‚ÄúNew User Assigned to Privileged Role‚Äù alert. The alert was flagged with the Persistence tactic, and the context revealed unauthorized privilege escalation to a previously unprivileged user ‚Äî a potential foothold for lateral movement. By correlating entity relationships like IPs, users, and role changes, I validated the severity of the threat and confirmed Zero Trust controls were functioning as intended. This deeper analysis accelerated response prioritization ‚Äî a critical advantage in Lean SOC operations.   | ![Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel Timeline view showing sequence of attacker actions across cloud services](./assets/Persistant_attack.png) |
| **üéØ Conditional Access Policy enforcement(**80.21%** Identity Score)**
This screenshot reflects my implementation and continuous enforcement of Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra ID, achieving an 80.21% identity security score. Policies enforced include MFA for privileged roles, blocking legacy authentication, and device-based access restrictions. I aligned most configurations with Microsoft‚Äôs Zero Trust recommendations while testing custom policies in Report-Only mode for iterative evaluation. This demonstrates my capability to operationalize adaptive access control using identity posture metrics to assess effectiveness and gaps.| ![Screenshot of Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access Policies configuration](./assets/Conditional_access_policies.png)<br>![Screenshot showing Microsoft Entra ID Identity Security Score of 80.21%](./assets/Identity_score.png)  |
|**üñ•Ô∏è Device monitoring in Endpoint Central**
 This view illustrates my endpoint vulnerability and patch compliance monitoring across a hybrid fleet using Endpoint Central, integrated with Microsoft Entra ID for device identity governance. It shows how I maintain visibility into OS versions, patch levels, critical vulnerabilities, and compliance status across remote and on-prem devices. My configuration supports automated patch deployment, threat detection, and device health tracking‚Äîforming a foundational layer of defense for endpoint hardening.                                                        | ![Screenshot of Endpoint Central device monitoring dashboard showing vulnerability status and patch compliance](./assets/Device_monitoring.png)|
|**Microsoft Purview Compliance Score (**97%**)**  
This updated screenshot reflects a 97% compliance score in Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager, showcasing my proactive enforcement of security, privacy, and regulatory controls across Microsoft 365 and hybrid cloud environments. I aligned policies and technical configurations with key frameworks including SOX, NYDFS, GLBA, NIST, PCI-DSS, CIS Controls, ISO 27001, and Microsoft‚Äôs internal security benchmarks. This score reflects my hands-on work in implementing conditional access, data loss prevention, secure device configurations, auditing policies, and user risk controls ‚Äî all tracked and measured through Purview‚Äôs continuous assessments.   | ![Screenshot of Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager showing compliance score of 97%](./assets/Compliance_score.png) |
