# 🛡️ Hybrid Zero Trust Architecture – Multi-Cloud & SaaS Integration

This repository showcases a conceptual reference architecture I designed for a hybrid multi-cloud Zero Trust security model. The design integrates identity, access control, monitoring, and secure remote access across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS environments.

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Zero Trust Security** – applied across user, device, and network levels
- **Hybrid Identity Management** – federated and centralized via a cloud-native IdP
- **Multi-Cloud Architecture** – secure interconnection of on-prem, Azure, AWS, and SaaS
- **Secure Access Enforcement** – VPN, Conditional Access, and ZTNA
